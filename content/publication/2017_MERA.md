abstract = "In this paper, the authors describe Musical Entities Reconciliation Architecture (MERA), an architecture designed to link music-related databases adapting the reconciliation techniques to each particular case. MERA includes mechanisms to manage third party sources to improve the results and it makes use of semantic technologies, storing and organizing the information in RDF graphs. They have implemented a prototype of their approach and have used it to link sources with different levels of data quality. The prototype has been effective in more than 94% of the cases under the conditions of their experiments. The authors have also compared their prototype with a well-known music-specialized search engine, outperforming the search results in the two experiments that they performed."
