abstract = "In this paper we propose a combination between collaborative tagging and semantic web technologies for the development of an image repository system. The proposed system will be part of the WESONET project which will also handle other types of resources like video and audio. Our approach combines low level features extracted by automatic means, high level descriptions provided by the content creators and sets of tags dynamically added by end-users."
