abstract = "RDF forms the basis of the semantic web technology stack. It is based on a directed graph model where nodes and edges are identified by URIs. Occasionally, such graphs contain literals or blank nodes. The existential nature of blank nodes complicates the graph representation. In this paper we propose a purely functional representation of RDF graphs using a special form of inductive graphs called inductive triple graphs. We employ logical variables to represent blank nodes. This approach can be implemented in any functional programming language such as Haskell and Scala."
